# METER SELECTION AND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

## 1. Clause 2.17: Power Quality Meter Requirements

### Tender Requirements
- Voltage Accuracy ±0.5%
- RS-485 Modbus Communication
- IEC 61850 Compliance
- LCD Display Required

### Selected Meter: PM8240

**Description**: From PM8000_Series

### Compliance Analysis

**Overall Assessment**: The selected meter appears to meet the technical requirements with the following considerations:

- The PM8240 model from the PM8000 series meets all the specified requirements.
- It supports RS-485 Modbus Communication and IEC 61850 Compliance, while its voltage accuracy of ±0.5% is also within the acceptable range..

### Potential Areas for Improvement

- No specific limitations identified in the selected meter model.

### Alternative Options

**Alternative 1**: PM8140
- Description: Essential power quality meter with 64MB memory and 128 samples/cycle waveform capture.
- Key difference: The PM8140 offers advanced power quality analysis, which is not strictly required but can be useful for future needs.

**Alternative 2**: PM8340
- Description: Advanced power quality meter with Class A compliance, 512MB memory, and 512 samples/cycle.
- Key difference: The PM8340 offers advanced power quality analysis up to Class A compliance, which is more than required.
