### Clause 2.1 - Overview
**Category:** Requirements
**Relevance Score:** 9

**Complete Clause Text:**
2.1 Overview 

1. EMS – a fully redundant energy management system collecting electrical energy, power,

provide energy and power reporting, alarm and event recording. 
 
2. Shall be utilizing Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based control and monitoring 
system. 
 
3. The data shall be scanned at no more than 60 seconds intervals and shall be made 
available  as close to real-time as reasonably practical within the constraints of the 
systems. 

**Key Specifications Identified:**
- EMS is fully redundant.
- Uses PLC-based control and monitoring system.
- Data collection every 60 seconds with real-time availability.

### Clause 2.2 - Design Criteria
**Category:** Requirements
**Relevance Score:** 9

**Complete Clause Text:**
2.2 Design Criteria 

1. High Availability 
 
a. The EMS shall be fully redundant from servers and networks. 
 
b. EMS network to run on a secure, resilient, managed infrastructure, with no single point 
of failure. 
 
c. All elements, hardware and software shall be configured in a concurrently maintainable 
arrangement. 
 
d. The system architecture shall be based on industrial grade redundant hardware for 
Controllers, Input/Output (I/O) communication modules and power supplies thereby 
providing high degree of up-time and concurrent maintainability.   
 
e. Server redundancy shall also allow the maintenance and patching of systems without 
losing visibility or data. Upon detection of failure of the primary server, the secondary 
server shall assume control of data collection, alarm functions, applications, and allow 
user access within 10 seconds for controllers and within 60 seconds for high level 
interface. Primary server and secondary server shall operate in hot-standby mode, 
alarm shall be raised when there is any failure in the primary and secondary server or 
component.  
 
f. In the event of hardware failure for the primary controller or I/O communication 
controller module, the proposed system will automatically switch to secondary 
controller in less than 10 milli-seconds without need for any human intervention.   
 
g. The failure of any one part of each BMS, PMS, EMS system, controller, server or 
network component shall not cause failure of the particular system or the other 
systems. 
 
h. Non-redundant components such as I/O modules shall be hot swappable to reduce 
the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR). The I/O module electronics shall be replaced 
without removing the field or internal cables and software re-downloads 

**Key Specifications Identified:**
- EMS is fully redundant from servers and networks.
- High availability through concurrent maintainability.
- Automatic switching of controllers in less than 10 milliseconds.

vendors works.  
 
2. All equipment including outstations, controllers, networking, IO, servers and workstations 
shall be connected in the intended configuration to be used on site, with suitable lengths 
of fibre-optic cable to simulate the site communication links.  
 
3. Every input and output shall be tested, including spares, using hard-wired test boxes. 
Analogue inputs shall be injected through the entire range using a current injection set.  
 
4. All communications links, PLCs, servers, switches and power supplies shall be tested for 
redundancy and to demonstrate the correct detection and alarming of failures.
