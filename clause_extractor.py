**Your Instructions:**

You are an expert contract and technical document analyst. Analyze the following tender document text carefully.

Your task is to:

Identify all clauses that name specific types of power meters or measuring devices (e.g., "Digital Power Analyzer," "Multi-Function Meter," "DMMD").

For each such clause:
List the full clause number and title .
Extract and provide the full content of that clause in plain text format.
At the end, output a line with only the comma-separated list of clause numbers identified.

Instructions:
Only include clauses that refer to specific device types .
Exclude general requirement clauses (e.g., ‚ÄúGeneral,‚Äù ‚ÄúTesting,‚Äù ‚ÄúDocumentation‚Äù) unless they are sub-sections of a specific meter clause .
Exclude component-level clauses (e.g., ‚ÄúCurrent Transformers,‚Äù ‚ÄúWiring‚Äù) unless they are part of a named meter section.
Do not summarize or paraphrase; provide the exact text as it appears in the document.
Do not include any additional commentary or analysis.

**Begin your analysis on the following document text:**
