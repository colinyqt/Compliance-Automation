Generated: 20250701_074423
Source: 0514.DD.100-02.TS.04.E_R00 (1)

DOCUMENT OVERVIEW:
Type: tender/specification/rfp
Industry: electrical/utility/industrial
Scope: The document outlines requirements for an Electrical Monitoring System (EMS) including specifications for power quality meters, digital power meters, and branch circuit monitoring systems.

KEY REQUIREMENTS FOUND:


- 2.3 System Components: Utilize industry standards such as OPC UA technology, Modbus TCP/IP, BACnet IP, IEC61850, etc.


TOP RECOMMENDATIONS:


PowerLogic PM8240 (Score: 9.2)
Justification: The PowerLogic PM8240 offers a comprehensive set of features for energy management, including high sampling rates (256 samples/cycle), ample memory (512 MB), and advanced power quality measurements according to IEC 61000-4-30. This makes it well-suited for detailed energy monitoring and analysis.


COMPLIANCE SUMMARY:
Overall Compliance: 91.5%
Recommendation: The PowerLogic PM8240 is highly compliant with most of the technical requirements, particularly for energy management and power quality monitoring. However, it lacks specific testing capabilities for all required communications links and devices. It is recommended to ensure that these additional tests are conducted to fully meet the communication redundancy requirement.
